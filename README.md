# Box Mover

Final projects for *Introduction to Java Programming*. Fall 2013.

Coded individually by *Fengshuang Li*

## Summary

The project includes two parts

- Project 1 is a box mover game running in the terminal, which represents game state and receives user commands in plain text format.
- Project 2 is an enhanced version of Project 1, which build a GUI interface in the theme of game [古剑奇谭 2 (Sword of Legend 2)](http://gjqt.wangyuan.com/gj2/index.shtml)

## Technical facts

- The game is coded in Java.
- The GUI framework is Java Swing.
- As the game is my first application, the quality of the code is not good. Shame to read my naive code, LOL.
- Only tested on my old laptop. Not sure whether it would run properly now, especially Project 2.
